Summary of Capital one coding challenge:

Important information:
1. Overview of Node Modules used:
    - Underscore : It is an open-source JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers.
    - indicative : This javascript library provides schema based validation.
2. Overview of Model, Routes, Database:
    - Database : "./app/models/database.js" file initialized all the models and required in routes file.
    - Model : "./app/models" directory contain all the models that are being initialized in "database.js" file
    - Routes : "./app/routes/routes.js" contains all the routes because of small project I decided to use same file for both
                measurement and statistics.
3. Manual Validation:
    - Because of indicative's limitations, I added manual validations for few extra check.
    - You can post invalid fields with valid ones ['timestamp', 'temperature', 'dewPoint','precipitation'].
    invalid fields will be ignored automatically.
    - Api is using parseFloat so it will work even if you post string "20.5" instead of float.

4. Future tasks:
    - I couldn't submit test script because of time limit.
    - I used "postman" tool to do all the testing.

5. Online API:
    - I have deployed this api to my EC2 instance for testing.(http://52.27.26.188/api)

This project was fun, learned a lot about REST api. Thank you!
